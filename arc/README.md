# Gui classes implement & Sample
*There are many Gui pages in project usually. And some pages of them with the same page style. For example, Notification pages for notify user their commands are done. So make Notification page as a page style and create a class to define this page style. In order to reduce the same code that draws Notification page repeated continuously. There are attributes in Notification class like notify string, font size and maybe one button for leave Notification page. After define a Notification class, you can create a Notification page by using class and put  in notify string, define font size you want. And this sample is for expressing the basic idea above.*
